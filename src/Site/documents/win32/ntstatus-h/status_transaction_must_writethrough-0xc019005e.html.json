title: 0xC019005E STATUS_TRANSACTION_MUST_WRITETHROUGH in ntstatus.h
description: The transaction cannot be enlisted on with the specified EnlistmentMask, because the transaction has already completed the PrePrepare phase.  In order to ensure correctness, the ResourceManager must switch to a write-through mode and cease caching data within this transaction.  Enlisting for only subsequent transaction phases may still succeed.
