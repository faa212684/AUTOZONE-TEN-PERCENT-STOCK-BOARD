title: -2144108254 ERROR_WSMAN_CANNOT_PROCESS_FILTER in wsmerror.h
description: The data source could not process the filter. The filter might be missing, invalid or too complex to process.
If a service only supports a subset of a filter dialect (such as XPath level 1), it may return this fault for valid
filter expressions outside of the supported subset.
Change the filter and try the request again.
