description: The WinRM client cannot process the request. A computer policy does not allow the delegation of the user credentials to the target computer.
Use gpedit.msc and look at the following policy: Computer Configuration -> Administrative Templates -> System -> Credentials Delegation -> Allow Delegating Fresh Credentials. 
Verify that it is enabled and configured with an SPN appropriate for the target computer.
For example, for a target computer name "myserver.domain.com", the SPN can be one of the following: WSMAN/myserver.domain.com or WSMAN/*.domain.com.
