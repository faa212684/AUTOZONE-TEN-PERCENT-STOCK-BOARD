title: 0x80002B95 EVENT_DNSAPI_PTR_REGISTRATION_FAILED_SERVERFAIL in netevent.h
description: The system failed to register pointer (PTR) resource records (RRs)
for network adapter%nwith settings:%n%n
Adapter Name : %1%n
Host Name : %2%n
Adapter-specific Domain Suffix : %3%n
DNS server list :%n
%4%n
Sent update to server : %5%n
IP Address : %6%n%n
The cause was DNS server failure. This may because the reverse lookup
zone is busy or missing on the DNS server that your computer needs to
update. In most cases, this is a minor problem because it does not
affect normal (forward) name resolution.%n%n If reverse (address-to-name)
resolution is required for your computer, you can manually retry DNS
registration of the network adapter and its settings by typing 
"ipconfig /registerdns" at the command prompt. If problems still 
persist, contact your DNS server or network systems administrator. 
See event details for specific error code information.
