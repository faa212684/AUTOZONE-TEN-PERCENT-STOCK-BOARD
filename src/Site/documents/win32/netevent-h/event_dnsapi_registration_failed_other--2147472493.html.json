title: -2147472493 EVENT_DNSAPI_REGISTRATION_FAILED_OTHER in netevent.h
description: The system failed to register network adapter with settings:%n%n
Adapter Name : %1%n
Host Name : %2%n
Adapter-specific Domain Suffix : %3%n
DNS server list :%n
%4%n
Sent update to server : %5%n
IP Address(es) :%n
%6%n%n
The reason the DNS update request could not be completed was because
of a system problem. You can manually retry DNS registration of the
network adapter and its settings by typing "ipconfig /registerdns"
at the command prompt. If problems still persist, contact your DNS
server or network systems administrator. See event details for 
specific error code information.
