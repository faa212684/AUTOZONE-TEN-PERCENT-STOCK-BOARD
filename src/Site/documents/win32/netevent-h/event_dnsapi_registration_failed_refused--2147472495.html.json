description: The system failed to register network adapter with settings:%n%n
Adapter Name : %1%n
Host Name : %2%n
Adapter-specific Domain Suffix : %3%n
DNS server list :%n
%4%n
Sent update to server : %5%n
IP Address(es) :%n
%6%n%n
The reason it could not register was because the DNS server refused the
dynamic update request. This could happen for the following reasons:
(a) current DNS update policies do not allow this computer to update
the DNS domain name configured for this adapter, or (b) the authoritative
DNS server for this DNS domain name does not support the DNS dynamic update
protocol.%n%n
To register a DNS host (A or AAAA) resource record using the specific DNS 
domain name for this adapter, contact your DNS server or network systems
administrator.
