title: 0x80002B2A EVENT_DNS_CACHE_NETWORK_PERF_WARNING in netevent.h
description: The DNS Client service could not contact any DNS servers for
a repeated number of attempts. For the next %3 seconds the
DNS Client service will not use the network to avoid further
network performance problems. It will resume its normal behavior
after that. If this problem persists, verify your TCP/IP
configuration, specifically check that you have a preferred
(and possibly an alternate) DNS server configured. If the problem
continues, verify network conditions to these DNS servers or contact
your network administrator.
