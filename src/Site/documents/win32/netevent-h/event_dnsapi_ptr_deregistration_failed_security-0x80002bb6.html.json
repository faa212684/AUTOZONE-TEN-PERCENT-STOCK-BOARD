title: 0x80002BB6 EVENT_DNSAPI_PTR_DEREGISTRATION_FAILED_SECURITY in netevent.h
description: The system failed to update and remove pointer (PTR) resource records (RRs)
for network adapter%nwith settings:%n%n
Adapter Name : %1%n
Host Name : %2%n
Adapter-specific Domain Suffix : %3%n
DNS server list :%n
%4%n
Sent update to server : %5%n
IP Address : %6%n%n
The system could not remove these PTR RRs because of a security related
problem. The cause of this could be that (a) your computer does not have
permissions to remove and update the specific DNS domain name or IP addresses
configured for this adapter, or (b) there might have been a problem negotiating
valid credentials with the DNS server during the processing of the update
request. See event details for specific error code information.
