title: 0x80002B8F EVENT_DNSAPI_REGISTRATION_FAILED_SERVERFAIL in netevent.h
description: The system failed to register network adapter with settings:%n%n
Adapter Name : %1%n
Host Name : %2%n
Adapter-specific Domain Suffix : %3%n
DNS server list :%n
%4%n
Sent update to server : %5%n
IP Address(es) :%n
%6%n%n
The cause of this DNS registration failure was because of DNS server failure.
This may be due to a zone transfer that has locked the DNS server for the
applicable zone that your computer needs to register itself with.%n%n
(The applicable zone should typically correspond to the Adapter-specific
Domain Suffix that was indicated above.) You can manually retry registration
of the network adapter and its settings by typing "ipconfig /registerdns"
at the command prompt. If problems still persist, contact your network
systems administrator to verify network conditions.
