title: -2147470133 EVENT_FRS_SYSVOL_NOT_READY_PRIMARY in netevent.h
description: The File Replication Service may be preventing the computer %1 from becoming a
domain controller while the system volume is being initialized and then
shared as SYSVOL.
%n
%nType "net share" to check for the SYSVOL share. The File Replication
Service has stopped preventing the computer from becoming a domain
controller once the SYSVOL share appears.
%n
%nThe initialization of the system volume can take some time.
The time is dependent on the amount of data in the system volume.
%n
%nThe initialization of the system volume can be bypassed by first typing
regedt32 and setting the value of SysvolReady to 1 and then restarting
the Netlogon service.
%n
%nWARNING - BYPASSING THE SYSTEM VOLUME INITIALIZATION IS NOT RECOMMENDED.
Applications may fail in unexpected ways.
%n
%nThe value SysvolReady is located by clicking on HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
and then clicking on System, CurrentControlSet, Services, Netlogon,
and Parameters.
%n
%nThe Netlogon service can be restarted by typing "net stop netlogon"
followed by "net start netlogon".
