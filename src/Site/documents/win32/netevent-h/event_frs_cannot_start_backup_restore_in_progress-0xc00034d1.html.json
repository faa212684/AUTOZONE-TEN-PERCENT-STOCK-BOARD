description: The File Replication Service cannot enable replication on the comptuer %1
until a backup/restore application completes.
%n
%nA backup/restore application has set a registry key that
prevents the File Replication Service from starting until the registry
key is deleted or the system is rebooted.
%n
%nThe backup/restore application may still be running. Check with your
local administrator before proceeding further.
%n
%nThe computer can be rebooted by clicking on Start, Shutdown, and
selecting Restart.

Applications may fail in unexpected ways.
%n
%nThe registry key can be deleted by running regedt32.
%n
%nClick on Start, Run, and type regedt32.
%n
%nClick on the window entitled HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE. Double click on SYSTEM,
CurrentControlSet, Services, NtFrs, Parameters, Backup/Restore,
"Stop NtFrs from Starting". On the toolbar, click on Edit and select
Delete. Be careful! Deleting a key other than "Stop NtFrs From Starting"
