title: -1073728263 EVENT_FRS_REPLICA_IN_JRNL_WRAP_ERROR in netevent.h
description: The File Replication Service has detected that the replica set "%1" is in JRNL_WRAP_ERROR.
%n
%n Replica set name is    : "%1"
%n Replica root path is   : "%2"
%n Replica root volume is : "%3"
%n
A Replica set hits JRNL_WRAP_ERROR when the record that it is trying to read from the NTFS USN journal is not found.
This can occur because of one of the following reasons.
%n
%n [1] Volume "%3" has been formatted.
%n [2] The NTFS USN journal on volume "%3" has been deleted.
%n [3] The NTFS USN journal on volume "%3" has been truncated. Chkdsk can truncate
the journal if it finds corrupt entries at the end of the journal.
%n [4] File Replication Service was not running on this computer for a long time.
%n [5] File Replication Service could not keep up with the rate of Disk IO activity on "%3".
%n
%n Following recovery steps will be taken to automatically recover from this error state.
%n [1] At the first poll which will occur in %4 minutes this computer will be
deleted from the replica set.
%n [2] At the poll following the deletion this computer will be re-added to the
replica set. The re-addition will trigger a full tree sync for the replica set.
