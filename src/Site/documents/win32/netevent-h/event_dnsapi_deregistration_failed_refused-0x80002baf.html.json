description: The system failed to update and remove registration for the network
adapter with settings:%n%n
Adapter Name : %1%n
Host Name : %2%n
Adapter-specific Domain Suffix : %3%n
DNS server list :%n
%4%n
Sent update to server : %5%n
IP Address(es) :%n
%6%n%n
The reason the system could not perform the update request was the
DNS server contacted refused update request. The cause of this is
(a) this computer is not allowed to update the specified DNS domain
name, or (b) because the DNS server authoritative for the zone that
requires updating does not support the DNS dynamic update protocol.
