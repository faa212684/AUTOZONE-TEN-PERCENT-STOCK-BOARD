title: 0x80002B9D EVENT_DNSAPI_REGISTRATION_FAILED_REFUSED_PRIMARY_DN in netevent.h
description: The system failed to register host (A or AAAA) resource records (RRs) for
network adapter%nwith settings:%n%n
Adapter Name : %1%n
Host Name : %2%n
Primary Domain Suffix : %3%n
DNS server list :%n
%4%n
Sent update to server : %5%n
IP Address(es) :%n
%6%n%n
The reason the system could not register these RRs was because the
DNS server contacted refused the update request. The reasons for this
might be (a) you are not allowed to update the specified DNS domain name,
or (b) because the DNS server authoritative for this name does not support
the DNS dynamic update protocol.%n%n
To register the DNS host (A or AAAA) resource records using the specific DNS
domain name and IP addresses for this adapter, contact your DNS server
or network systems administrator.
