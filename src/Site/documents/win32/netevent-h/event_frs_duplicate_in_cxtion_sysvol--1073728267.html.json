description: The File Replication Service has detected a duplicate connection object between
this computer "%6" and a computer named "%1".
%nThis was detected for the following replica set:
%n    "%2"
%n
%nThis is not allowed and replication will not occur between these two
computers until the duplicate connection objects are removed.
%n
%nIt is possible that this is a transient error due to Active Directory
replication delays associated with updating FRS configuration objects.  If
file replication does not take place after an appropriate waiting time,
which could be several hours if cross site Active Directory replication
is required, you must manually delete the duplicate connection objects by
following the steps below:
%n
%n [1] Start the Active Directory Sites and Services Snapin.
%n [2] Click on "%3, %4, %5, %6, %7".
%n [3] Look for duplicate connections from "%1" in site "%8".
%n [4] Delete all but one of the connections.
