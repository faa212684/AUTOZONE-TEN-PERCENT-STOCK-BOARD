title: 0xC0001B81 EVENT_SERVICE_LOGON_TYPE_NOT_GRANTED in netevent.h
description: The %1 service was unable to log on as %2 with the currently configured
password due to the following error:
%nLogon failure: the user has not been granted the requested logon type at this
computer.%n
%nService: %1
%nDomain and account: %2%n
%nThis service account does not have the necessary user right "Log on as a service."%n
%nUser Action%n
%nAssign "Log on as a service" to the service account on this computer. You can
use Local Security Settings (Secpol.msc) to do this. If this computer is a
node in a cluster, check that this user right is assigned to the Cluster
service account on all nodes in the cluster.%n
%nIf you have already assigned this user right to the service account, and the
user right appears to be removed, a Group Policy object associated with this
node might be removing the right. Check with your domain administrator to find
out if this is happening.
