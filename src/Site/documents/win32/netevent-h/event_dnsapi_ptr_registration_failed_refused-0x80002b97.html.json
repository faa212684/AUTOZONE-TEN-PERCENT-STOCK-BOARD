title: 0x80002B97 EVENT_DNSAPI_PTR_REGISTRATION_FAILED_REFUSED in netevent.h
description: The system failed to register pointer (PTR) resource records (RRs)
for network adapter%nwith settings:%n%n
Adapter Name : %1%n
Host Name : %2%n
Adapter-specific Domain Suffix : %3%n
DNS server list :%n
%4%n
Sent update to server : %5%n
IP Address : %6%n%n
The reason that the system could not register these RRs was because
the DNS server refused the update request. The cause of this could
be (a) your computer is not allowed to update the adapter-specified DNS
domain name, or (b) because the DNS server authoritative for the specified
name does not support the DNS dynamic update protocol.%n%n
To register the DNS pointer (PTR) resource records using the specific
DNS domain name and IP addresses for this adapter, contact your DNS
server or network systems administrator.
