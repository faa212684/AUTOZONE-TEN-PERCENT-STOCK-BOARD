title: 0x80002BAC EVENT_DNSAPI_DEREGISTRATION_FAILED_TIMEOUT in netevent.h
description: The system failed to update and remove registration for the
network adapter with settings:%n%n
Adapter Name : %1%n
Host Name : %2%n
Adapter-specific Domain Suffix : %3%n
DNS server list :%n
%4%n
Sent update to server : %5%n
IP Address(es) :%n
%6%n%n
The reason for this failure is because the DNS server it sent the update
request to timed out. The most likely cause of this failure is that the
DNS server authoritative for the zone where the registration was originally
made is either not running or unreachable through the network at this time.
