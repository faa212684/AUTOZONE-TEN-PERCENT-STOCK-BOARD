title: -2147472481 EVENT_DNSAPI_REGISTRATION_FAILED_OTHER_PRIMARY_DN in netevent.h
description: The system failed to register host (A or AAAA) resource records (RRs) for
network adapter%nwith settings:%n%n
Adapter Name : %1%n
Host Name : %2%n
Primary Domain Suffix : %3%n
DNS server list :%n
%4%n
Sent update to server : %5%n
IP Address(es) :%n
%6%n%n
The reason the system could not register these RRs during the
update request was because of a system problem. You can manually
retry DNS registration of the network adapter and its settings by
typing "ipconfig /registerdns" at the command prompt. If problems
still persist, contact your DNS server or network systems
administrator. See event details for specific error code information.
