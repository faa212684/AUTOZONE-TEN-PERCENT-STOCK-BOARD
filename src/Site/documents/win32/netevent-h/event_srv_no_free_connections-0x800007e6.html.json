title: 0x800007E6 EVENT_SRV_NO_FREE_CONNECTIONS in netevent.h
description: The server was unable to find a free connection %2 times in the last %3 seconds.  This indicates a spike in
network traffic.  If this is happening frequently, you should consider increasing the minimum number of free
connections to add headroom.  To do that, modify the MinFreeConnections and MaxFreeConnections for the LanmanServer
in the registry.
