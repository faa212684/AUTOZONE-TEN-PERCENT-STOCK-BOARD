title: 0x80001083 EVENT_TCPIP_TCP_TIME_WAIT_COLLISION in netevent.h
description: TCP/IP failed to establish an outgoing connection because the selected local endpoint
was recently used to connect to the same remote endpoint. This error typically occurs
when outgoing connections are opened and closed at a high rate, causing all available
local ports to be used and forcing TCP/IP to reuse a local port for an outgoing connection.
To minimize the risk of data corruption, the TCP/IP standard requires a minimum time period
to elapse between successive connections from a given local endpoint to a given remote endpoint.
