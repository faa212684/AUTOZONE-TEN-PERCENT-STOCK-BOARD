description: The system failed to register network adapter with settings:%n%n
Adapter Name : %1%n
Host Name : %2%n
Adapter-specific Domain Suffix : %3%n
DNS server list :%n
%4%n
Sent update to server : %5%n
IP Address(es) :%n
%6%n%n
The system could not register the DNS update request because of a
security related problem. This could happen for the following reasons:
(a) the DNS domain name that your computer is trying to register could
not be updated because your computer does not have the right permissions,
or (b) there might have been a problem negotiating valid credentials
with the DNS server to update.%n%n
You can manually retry DNS registration of the network adapter and its
settings by typing "ipconfig /registerdns" at the command prompt. If
problems still persist, contact your DNS server or network systems
administrator. See event details for specific error code information.
