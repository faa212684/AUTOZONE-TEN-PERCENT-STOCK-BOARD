title: 0xC00034F7 EVENT_FRS_ROOT_HAS_MOVED in netevent.h
description: The File Replication Service has detected that the replica root path has changed
from "%2" to "%3". If this is an intentional move then a file with the name
NTFRS_CMD_FILE_MOVE_ROOT needs to be created under the new root path.
%nThis was detected for the following replica set:
%n    "%1"
%n
%nChanging the replica root path is a two step process which is triggered by
the creation of the NTFRS_CMD_FILE_MOVE_ROOT file.
%n
%n [1] At the first poll which will occur in %4 minutes this computer will be
deleted from the replica set.
%n [2] At the poll following the deletion this computer will be re-added to the
replica set with the new root path. This re-addition will trigger a full tree
sync for the replica set. At the end of the sync all the files will be at the new
location. The files may or may not be deleted from the old location depending on whether
they are needed or not.
