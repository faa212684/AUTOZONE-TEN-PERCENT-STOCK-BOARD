title: 0x80002B8E EVENT_DNSAPI_REGISTRATION_FAILED_TIMEOUT in netevent.h
description: The system failed to register network adapter with settings:%n%n
Adapter Name : %1%n
Host Name : %2%n
Adapter-specific Domain Suffix : %3%n
DNS Server list :%n
%4%n
Sent update to server : %5%n
IP Address(es) :%n
%6%n%n
The cause of this DNS registration failure was because the DNS update
request timed out after being sent to the specified DNS Server. This is
probably because the authoritative DNS server for the name being updated
is not running.%n%n You can manually retry registration of the network
adapter and its settings by typing "ipconfig /registerdns" at the command
prompt. If problems still  persist, contact your network systems
administrator to verify network conditions.
