title: -2147472488 EVENT_DNSAPI_PTR_REGISTRATION_FAILED_SECURITY in netevent.h
description: The system failed to register pointer (PTR) resource records (RRs)
for network adapter%nwith settings:%n%n
Adapter Name : %1%n
Host Name : %2%n
Adapter-specific Domain Suffix : %3%n
DNS server list :%n
%4%n
Sent update to server : %5%n
IP Address : %6%n%n
The reason that the system could not register these RRs was because
of a security related problem. The cause of this could be (a) your
computer does not have permissions to register and update the specific
DNS domain name set for this adapter, or (b) there might have been a
problem negotiating valid credentials with the DNS server during the
processing of the update request.%n%n
You can manually retry DNS registration of the network adapter and
its settings by typing "ipconfig /registerdns" at the command prompt.
If problems still persist, contact your DNS server or network systems
administrator.
