description: The system failed to update and remove host (A or AAAA) resource records (RRs)
for network adapter%nwith settings:%n%n
Adapter Name : %1%n
Host Name : %2%n
Primary Domain Suffix : %3%n
DNS server list :%n
%4%n
Sent update to server : %5%n
IP Address(es) :%n
%6%n%n
The reason for this failure was because of a security related problem.
The cause of this could be that (a) your computer does not have permissions
to remove and update the specific DNS domain name or IP addresses
configured for this adapter, or (b) there might have been a problem
negotiating valid credentials with the DNS server during the processing of
the update request. See event details for specific error code information.
