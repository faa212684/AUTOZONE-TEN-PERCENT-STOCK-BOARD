title: 0x800034D0 EVENT_FRS_MOVED_PREEXISTING in netevent.h
description: The File Replication Service moved the preexisting files in %1 to %2.
%n
%nThe File Replication Service may delete the files in %2 at any time.
Files can be saved from deletion by copying them out of %2. Copying
the files into %1 may lead to name conflicts if the files already exist
on some other replicating partner.
%n
%nIn some cases, the File Replication Service may copy a file
from %2 into %1 instead of replicating the file from some other
replicating partner.
%n
%nSpace can be recovered at any time by deleting the files in %2.
