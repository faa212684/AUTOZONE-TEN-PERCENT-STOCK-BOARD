title: -2147472486 EVENT_DNSAPI_REGISTRATION_FAILED_TIMEOUT_PRIMARY_DN in netevent.h
description: The system failed to register host (A or AAAA) resource records (RRs) for
network adapter%nwith settings:%n%n
Adapter Name : %1%n
Host Name : %2%n
Primary Domain Suffix : %3%n
DNS server list :%n
%4%n
Sent update to server : %5%n
IP Address(es) :%n
%6%n%n
The reason the system could not register these RRs was because the
update request it sent to the DNS server timed out. The most likely
cause of this is that the DNS server authoritative for the name it
was attempting to register or update is not running at this time.%n%n
You can manually retry DNS registration of the network adapter and
its settings by typing "ipconfig /registerdns" at the command prompt.
If problems still persist, contact your DNS server or network systems
administrator.
