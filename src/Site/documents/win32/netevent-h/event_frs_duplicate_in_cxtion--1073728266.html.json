title: -1073728266 EVENT_FRS_DUPLICATE_IN_CXTION in netevent.h
description: The File Replication Service has detected a duplicate connection object between
this computer "%7" and a computer named "%1".
%nThis was detected for the following replica set:
%n    "%2"
%n
%nThis is not allowed and replication will not occur between these two
computers until the duplicate connection objects are removed.
%n
%nIt is possible that this is a transient error due to Active Directory
replication delays associated with updating FRS configuration objects.  If
file replication does not take place after an appropriate waiting time,
which could be several hours if cross site Active Directory replication
is required, you must manually delete the duplicate connection objects by
following the steps below:
%n
%n [1] Start the Active Directory Users and Computers Snapin.
%n [2] Click the view button and advanced features to display the system node.
%n [3] Click on "%3, %4, %5".
%n [4] Under "%5" you will see one or more DFS related replica set objects.
Look for the FRS member object "%6" under the subtree for replica set "%2".
%n [5] Under "%6" look for duplicate connections from "%1".
%n [6] Delete all but one of the connections.
