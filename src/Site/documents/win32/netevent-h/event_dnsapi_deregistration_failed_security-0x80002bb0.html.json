title: 0x80002BB0 EVENT_DNSAPI_DEREGISTRATION_FAILED_SECURITY in netevent.h
description: The system failed to update and remove registration for the network
adapter with settings:%n%n
Adapter Name : %1%n
Host Name : %2%n
Adapter-specific Domain Suffix : %3%n
DNS server list :%n
%4%n
Sent update to server : %5%n
IP Address(es) :%n
%6%n%n
The reason the system could not perform the update request was because
of a security related problem. The cause of this could be (a) your computer
does not have permissions to register and update the specific DNS domain
name set for this adapter, or (b) there might have been a problem negotiating
valid credentials with the DNS server during the processing of the update
request.%n%n
See event details for specific error code information.
