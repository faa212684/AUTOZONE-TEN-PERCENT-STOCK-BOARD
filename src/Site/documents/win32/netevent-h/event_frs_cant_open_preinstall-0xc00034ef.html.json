title: 0xC00034EF EVENT_FRS_CANT_OPEN_PREINSTALL in netevent.h
description: The File Replication Service is unable to open (or create) the pre-install
directory under the customer designated replica tree directory for
replica set %1.  The path used for the pre-install
directory is,
%n    "%2"
%nThe customer designated root path for this replica set is:
%n    "%3"
%n
The service is unable to start replication on this replica set.  Among the
possible errors to check are:
%n  --  an invalid root path,
%n  --  a missing directory,
%n  --  a missing disk volume,
%n  --  a file system on the volume that does not support NTFS 5.0
%n  --  a sharing conflict on the pre-install directory with some other application.
%n
%nCorrect the problem and the service will attempt to restart replication
automatically at a later time.
