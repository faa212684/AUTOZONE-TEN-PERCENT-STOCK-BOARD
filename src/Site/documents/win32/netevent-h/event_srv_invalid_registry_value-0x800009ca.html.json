title: 0x800009CA EVENT_SRV_INVALID_REGISTRY_VALUE in netevent.h
description: The value named %1 in the server's registry key %2 was not valid, and was ignored.
If you want to change the value, change it to one that is the correct type and is
within the acceptable range, or delete the value to use the default. This value
might have been set up by an older program that did not use the correct boundaries.
