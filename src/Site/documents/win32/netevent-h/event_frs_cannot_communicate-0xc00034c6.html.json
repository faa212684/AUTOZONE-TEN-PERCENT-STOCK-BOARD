title: 0xC00034C6 EVENT_FRS_CANNOT_COMMUNICATE in netevent.h
description: The File Replication Service on the computer %1 cannot communicate with
the File Replication Service on the computer %2.
%n
%nVerify that the computer %2 is up and running.
%n
%nVerify that the File Replication Service is running on %2 by
typing "net start ntfrs" on %2.
%n
%nVerify that the network is functioning between %1 and %2 by
typing "ping %1" on %2 and "ping %2" on %1.
If the pings succeed then retry the failed operation.
If the pings fail then there may be problems with the DNS server.
%n
%nThe DNS server is responsible for mapping computer names to IP addresses.
The commands "ipconfig" and "nslookup" help diagnose problems with the
DNS server.
%n
%nTyping "ipconfig /all" will list the computer's IP address and the IP
address of the computer's DNS servers. Type "ping <DNS server's IP address>"
to verify that a DNS server is available. The DNS mapping for %2 or %1
can be verified by typing "nslookup" and then typing "%2" and then "%1"
on %1 and %2. Be sure to check out the DNS server on both %1 and %2;
a DNS problem on either computer will prevent proper communication.
%n
%nSome network problems between %1 and %2 can be cleared up by flushing
the DNS Resolver Cache. Type "ipconfig /flushdns".
%n
%nSome network problems between %1 and %2 can be cleared up by renewing
the IP address. Type "ipconfig /release" followed by "ipconfig /renew".
%n
%nSome network problems between %1 and %2 can be cleared up by resetting
the computer's DNS entry. Type "net stop NetLogon" followed by
"net start NetLogon".
%n
%nSome problems between %1 and %2 can be cleared up by restarting
the File Replication Service. Type "net stop ntfrs" followed by
"net start ntfrs".
%n
%nSome problems between %1 and %2 can be cleared up by restarting
the computers %1 and %2 AFTER CLOSING RUNNING APPLIATIONS,
especially dcpromo. Click on Start, Shutdown, select Restart, and
click on OK.
%n
%nOther network and computer problems are beyond the scope of
this event log message.
