title: -2147470134 EVENT_FRS_SYSVOL_NOT_READY in netevent.h
description: The File Replication Service may be preventing the computer %1 from becoming a
domain controller while the system volume is being initialized with data
from another domain controller and then shared as SYSVOL.
%n
%nType "net share" to check for the SYSVOL share. The File Replication
Service has stopped preventing the computer from becoming a domain
controller once the SYSVOL share appears.
%n
%nThe initialization of the system volume can take some time.
The time is dependent on the amount of data in the system volume,
the availability of other domain controllers, and the replication
interval between domain controllers.
