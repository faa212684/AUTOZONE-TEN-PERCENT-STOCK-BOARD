title: -1073728275 EVENT_FRS_RMTCO_TIME_SKEW in netevent.h
description: The File Replication Service is unable to replicate from a partner computer
because the event time associated with the file to be replicated is too far
into the future.  It is %1 minutes greater than the current time.  This can
happen if the system time on the partner computer was set incorrectly when
the file was created or updated.  To preserve the integrity of the replica
set this file update will not be performed or propagated further.
%n
%nThe file name is: "%2"
%nThe connection to the partner computer is:
%n  "%3"
%n
%nNote: If this time difference is close to a multiple of 60 minutes then it
is likely that this file may have been created or updated on the partner
computer while the computer was set to the incorrect time zone when its
computer time was initially set.  Check that the timezone and time are
correctly set on the partner computer.
