title: 0xC00010D7 EVENT_NBT_CREATE_DEVICE in netevent.h
description: Initialization failed because the driver device could not be created.
Use the string "%2" to identify the interface for which initialization
failed. It represents the MAC address of the failed interface or the 
Globally Unique Interface Identifier (GUID) if NetBT was unable to 
map from GUID to MAC address. If neither the MAC address nor the GUID were 
available, the string represents a cluster device name.
