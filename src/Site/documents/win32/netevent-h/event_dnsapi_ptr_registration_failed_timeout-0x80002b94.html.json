title: 0x80002B94 EVENT_DNSAPI_PTR_REGISTRATION_FAILED_TIMEOUT in netevent.h
description: The system failed to register pointer (PTR) resource records (RRs) for
network adapter%nwith settings:%n%n
Adapter Name : %1%n
Host Name : %2%n
Adapter-specific Domain Suffix : %3%n
DNS server list :%n
%4%n
Sent update to server : %5%n
IP Address : %6%n%n
The reason that the system could not register these RRs was because the
update request that was sent to the specified DNS server timed out. This
is probably because the authoritative DNS server for the name being
registered is not running.%n%n You can manually retry DNS registration
of the network adapter and its settings by typing "ipconfig /registerdns"
at the command prompt. If problems still persist, contact your DNS
server or network systems administrator. See event details for specific 
error code information.
