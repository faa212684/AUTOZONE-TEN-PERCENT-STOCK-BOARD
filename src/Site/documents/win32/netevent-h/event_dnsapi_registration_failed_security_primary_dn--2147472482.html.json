title: -2147472482 EVENT_DNSAPI_REGISTRATION_FAILED_SECURITY_PRIMARY_DN in netevent.h
description: The system failed to register host (A or AAAA) resource records (RRs) for
network adapter%nwith settings:%n%n
Adapter Name : %1%n
Host Name : %2%n
Primary Domain Suffix : %3%n
DNS server list :%n
%4%n
Sent update to server : %5%n
IP Address(es) :%n
%6%n%n
The reason the system could not register these RRs was because of a
security related problem. The cause of this could be (a) your computer
does not have permissions to register and update the specific DNS domain
name set for this adapter, or (b) there might have been a problem negotiating
valid credentials with the DNS server during the processing of the update
request.%n%n
You can manually retry DNS registration of the network adapter and
its settings by typing "ipconfig /registerdns" at the command prompt.
If problems still persist, contact your DNS server or network systems
administrator. See event details for specific error code information.
