title: 0x80002B9B EVENT_DNSAPI_REGISTRATION_FAILED_SERVERFAIL_PRIMARY_DN in netevent.h
description: The system failed to register host (A or AAAA) resource records (RRs) for
network adapter%nwith settings:%n%n
Adapter Name : %1%n
Host Name : %2%n
Primary Domain Suffix : %3%n
DNS server list :%n
%4%n
Sent update to server : %5%n
IP Address(es) :%n
%6%n%n
The reason the system could not register these RRs was because the
DNS server failed the update request. The most likely cause of this
is that the authoritative DNS server required to process this update
request has a lock in place on the zone, probably because a zone
transfer is in progress.%n%n
You can manually retry DNS registration of the network adapter and
its settings by typing "ipconfig /registerdns" at the command prompt.
If problems still persist, contact your DNS server or network systems
administrator.
