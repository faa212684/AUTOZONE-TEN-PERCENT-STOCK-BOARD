title: 0xC00034F4 EVENT_FRS_REPLICA_NO_ROOT_CHANGE in netevent.h
description: The File Replication Service has detected what appears to be an attempt
to change the root path for the following replica set:
%n    "%1"
%n
%nThis is not allowed.  To perform this operation you must remove this member
from the replica set and add the member back with the new root path.
%n
%nIt is possible that this is a transient error due to Active Directory
replication delays associated with updating FRS configuration objects.  If
file replication does not take place after an appropriate waiting time,
which could be several hours if cross site Active Directory replication
is required, you must delete and re-add this member to the replica set.
%n
%nInformation related to this event is shown below:
%nComputer DNS name is "%2"
%nReplica set member name is "%3"
%nThe current Replica set root path is "%4"
%nThe desired new Replica set root path is "%5"
%nReplica staging directory path is "%6"
