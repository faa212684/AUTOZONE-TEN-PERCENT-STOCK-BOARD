title: 0xC00034F0 EVENT_FRS_REPLICA_SET_CREATE_FAIL in netevent.h
description: The File Replication Service is unable to add this computer to the following
replica set:
%n    "%1"
%n
%nThis could be caused by a number of problems such as:
%n  --  an invalid root path,
%n  --  a missing directory,
%n  --  a missing disk volume,
%n  --  a file system on the volume that does not support NTFS 5.0
%n
%nThe information below may help to resolve the problem:
%nComputer DNS name is "%2"
%nReplica set member name is "%3"
%nReplica set root path is "%4"
%nReplica staging directory path is "%5"
%nReplica working directory path is "%6"
%nWindows error status code is %7
%nFRS error status code is %8
%n
%nOther event log messages may also help determine the problem.  Correct the
problem and the service will attempt to restart replication automatically at
a later time.
