title: -1073728276 EVENT_FRS_JOIN_FAIL_TIME_SKEW in netevent.h
description: The File Replication Service is unable to replicate with its partner computer
because the difference in clock times is outside the range of plus or minus
%1 minutes.
%n
%nThe connection to the partner computer is:
%n  "%2"
%nThe detected time difference is:  %3 minutes.
%n
%nNote: If this time difference is close to a multiple of 60 minutes then it
is likely that either this computer or its partner computer was set to the
incorrect time zone when the computer time was initially set.  Check that
the time zone and the system time are correctly set on both computers.
%n
%nIf necessary, the default value used to test for computer time consistency
may be changed in the registry on this computer.  (Note: This is not recommended.)
%n
%nTo change this parameter, run regedt32.
%n
%nClick on Start, Run and type regedt32.
%n
%nClick on the window entitled HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE.
%nClick down the key path:
%n   "System\CurrentControlSet\Services\NtFrs\Parameters"
%nDouble click on the value name
%n   "Partner Clock Skew In Minutes"
%nand update the value.
%n
%nIf the value name is not present you may add it with the Add Value function
under the Edit Menu item. Type the value name exactly as shown above using the
the registry data type REG_DWORD.
